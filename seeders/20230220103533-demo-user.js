        body: 'Ashtanga yoga is a dynamic form of yoga that is based on a series of poses. It is a vigorous practice that combines breath control, self-observation and meditation or relaxation. The word ashtanga means eight limbs in Sanskrit, which refers to the eight limbs of yoga described in Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras, the foundational text of yoga philosophy. Ashtanga yoga is also sometimes called “power yoga” because of its focus on building strength and stamina. The practice of ashtanga yoga is also known as “yoga chikitsa,” which means “yoga therapy.”',
